# Background

My team uses Wolt every day for our lunch order.  
We use Wolt's shared order and split the payment on Cibus.  
Instead of manually splitting the payment on Cibus,  
I've created this nice Chrome extension to achieve it automatically. 

# Setting Up

1. Visit [Pimp my Wolt](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pimp-my-wolt/edfemdoibbcbmkojfdeldnllcbnpmfld) Chrome Web Store page and click `Add to Chrome`.  

2. Set your group name. Different users may share the same group name for easier maintenance of group members:

3. Onboard new members to your group.  
Onboarding is done once and used for every future order.  
If you missed someone, don't worry, you can always try our automatic splitting algorithm:
